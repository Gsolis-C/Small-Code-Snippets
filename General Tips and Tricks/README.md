# General Tips and Tricks

Done trying to get whatever it is you're doing to work? Now's the time to go through this document. It's not trying to teach you anything. It's just spitballing on a couple of things that could help you on this strange profession of ours.

## Don't Panic

This would be a pretty good time for me to repeat this **DON'T PANIC!** Yes, I know that the code isn't working. Yes I know that the deadline is right now. Yes I know that your boss is a no-fun know-nothing-know-it-all that is hovering over your shoulder right now looking for the tiniest reason to fire you. This paragraph is probably good enough. Your fault for leaving it open.

All of this is precisely the reason you shouldn't panic. Apart from being recognized as someone who keeps their cool in dire situations, panic is just going to make things worse. Especially if you can't see a way out of it because of it.

## Document everything

At some point, you will be told to look at a codebase and figure out what's wrong with it. If you're lucky it will be your code. If you're not, it'll be someone elses. Whichever one it is, the experience will be much more pleasant if you find a couple of comments here and there. If you don't believe this is the case, code something reasonably complex and don't come back to it for six months, then see how easy it is for you to reverse-engineer your own code.

Comments don't need to be particularly verbose or complex. All they need to do is describe what the code is supposed to be doing right around where you place them. That way whomever takes your spot after you get promoted starts messing with your codebase won't need to spend however much time it would take for them to decipher it by feel.

## Code is not documentation

I thought of putting this one as a corollary to the previous section, but it'd would be best to put it separately to spare you and whomever reads your code from the confusion.

Yes, there is something to be said of self-documenting code The code itself is not the issue. It's trying to remember why you did things the way you did. Or worse, trying to know why someone else did them that way. I'm sure their code is self-explanatory to them, but it's likely it won't be for you.

## Anyone can ~~cook~~ code

Yes, there are coders that absolutely adore it. The ones that come into work early and stay late even when they aren't hourly. They can't work on the corporate codebase at home and that problem that they're facing is eating them alive. At home, they will have to resign themselves with that other problem that they have been tinkering with for the last couple of days.

It's okay if this isn't you.

The Greybeards may disagree. But the Greybeards have had years to hone their craft. They are also invariably from that subset of people who got so much into gaming that they made their own game engine. All you need to do is deliver your deliverables, not ruin the codebase, and demonstrate initiative if you feel it will benefit your career.

Keeping up with the Greybeards (and future Greybeards) is a road to frustration and feelings of inadequacy. You shouldn't feel guilty because most of your interest in programming ends roughly at the same time as the workday.

## Learn slowly

Allow me to save you a bunch of money. There's no way you can learn to develop *insert language of your choice here* in 24 hours. or 48. Or a week. You can learn the basics of a language in a week. But even those most talented people from the previous section will have difficulty creating something more complex than basic CRUD after such an intense session. 

That is unless, they spend every available hour in that week figuring it out. Which they probably will.

If the prospect of doing that fills you with dread instead of joy. You'll just have to accept that it'll take longer than you think it will. That story about the tortoise and the hare has had a long shelf life precisely because it can be applied to many things. Learning is one of them.
