 # The Desperate Programmer Guide for Beginners
 ## A Last Resource for the Clueless Programmer

Congratulations! You've not only finished whatever training you've had as a programmer, but now you're part of the lucky ones that can call this noble profession their job. You've gone through the interviews, met the team, have been presented with your computer and told where the water cooler and the bathrooms are. 

There's only one problem. At no point did anyone asked whether you know how to code or not. And now you're looking at your To-Do list and it looks about as friendly as a pack of hungry wolves. What are you to do?

Well, go check resources on the internet of course. But in a panic, it's very easy for even the most simple of instructions to look ridiculously complex. And with a deadline approaching or your coworkers suddenly very interested on your progress, panic is just a couple of searches away.

This guide (Cheat Sheet, really) is designed to help you with basic concepts, presenting them on a factual, if not completely serious, form that should be easier to digest in case it's 4:50 and you have to show something, *anything* at the daily standup at 5:00.

This repository will be periodically updated with new items. I hope you find it useful. And if you don't, relax; you're just not a part of [today's 10,000](https://xkcd.com/1053/ )
